  * A logger can have many appenders. And many loggers can also write to the SAME appender. So, you could configure loggers "A", "B", and "C" to all log to file "X".
  * Most comon way is to create a static logger instance per class, named for that class. This gives you a very high level of granularity for controlling your logging. Then you can configure certain loggers to write to one place.
